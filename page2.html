  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>I have been playing videogames most of my life. My first gaming device as a little kid was the Gameboy Advanced, I had so much fun playing with it. My second gaming conlsole was a PlayStation(the original one). I had a chance between Xbox and Playstation, and of course I made the right choice by picking the Playstation, then my journey began. With the Playstation I played games such as frogger and other great games from the Playstation. Then came the playstation 2 with even better games that I played, such as San Andres, Crach, Resident evil Fifa, and more.Then came PS3 and 4 where I currently play games such as GTA, COD, Fifa, and new ones like RL, MK, Fortnite and more .    </p></p>

    <h1>History</h1>
      <p>I have been playing videogames most of my life.
      My first gaming device as a little kid was the Gameboy Advanced, I had so much fun playing with it.
      My second gaming conlsole was a PlayStation(the original one). 
      I had a chance between Xbox and Playstation, and of course I made the right choice by picking the Playstation, then my journey began.
      With the Playstation, I played games such as frogger, Driver 2, Diablo, Road Rash   and other great games from Playstation.
      Then came the playstation 2 with even better games that I played, such as San Andres, Crash, Resident Evil, Fifa, and more.
      Then came PS3 and 4 where I currently play games such as GTA, COD, Fifa, and new ones like RL, MK, Fortnite and more.    </p></p>
